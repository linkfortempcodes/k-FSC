# k-FSC

kFSC: the original algorithm

kFSC_E: for data with sparse noise

kFSC_M: for data with missing values

kFSC_LARGE: k-FSC-L

kFSC_minibatch: k-FSC-MB

Please perform the algorithms for multiple trials to see the mean value and standard deviation. Just change the range of "i" in the scripts.

The codes were created and tested in MATLAB 2018a on MacBook Pro 2017.
